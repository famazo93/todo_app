# To-Do App by famazo
## This is a simple To-Do app built with vanilla JS on the frontend and express.js for the backend

to start the project:
1. install all dependencies with `npm install`
2. run server.js in the backend folder with `node server.js`
3. open `http://localhost:3000/`

Currently there is no database connected - while the server is running, tasks are fetched from, added to and removed from the database.js file.

Improvement ideas:
- add authentication (WIP)
- connect a database
- recreate frontend with React.js
